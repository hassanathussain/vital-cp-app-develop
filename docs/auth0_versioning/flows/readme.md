# Auth0 Actions Versioning Documentation

## Flows (Actions > Flows)

Auth0 allows you to hook into the authentication process using custom JavaScript code snippets (Actions) that are invoked at different parts of the process, thereby creating a custom flow (e.g., Post Change Password).

The purpose of this directory is to provide version control for our Auth0 Actions.
